# fractal
Tool to explore and generate images Mandelbrot, Julia, and other dynamical complex sets.

Features:
* Generate complex fractals using integer power `p` and complex number `c` with rules of the form
> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?z_{n+1}=z_n^p+c"/>

* Display and Navigate low resolution (dependent on terminal columns and lines) 6-color image of generated fractal
* Change maximum number of iterations to achieve more detailed images
* Identify complex points using Mouse
* Generate high resolution (specified by `-d, --dimensions` option) PNG images using various pre-set color scheme
  - With option to smooth color grade

### Help
For information about usage, use

    $ fractal --help

Controls:
* Arrow Keys : Move around complex plane
* Comma and Period : Zoom Out and In
* Left and Right Bracket : Decrease and Increase Maximum number of Iterations
* C : Toggle Continuous Coloring
* Y : Take Screenshot at resolution specified by `-d, --dimensions` option
* Q : Quit Program

### Design
For each pixel / cell in the terminal the application considers the corresponding complex number at that location `x`.

If the julia parameter, `-j, --julia` option is provided the complex number `j` then the orbit of `x` is the following sequence of complex numbers
> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?z_0=x"/>
>
> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?z_{n+1}=z_n^p+j"/>

If the julia parameter isn't provided, then the sequence is generated by
> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?z_0=0"/>
>
> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?z_{n+1}=z_n^p+x"/>

\
If for every element of the sequence before the maximum iteration point,
> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?|z_n|\leq%20r"/>

where `r` is the radius (which defaults to 2), then `x` is said to not escape.
The corresponding cell is colored black.
If the sequence does escape then the number of iteration necessary to do so determines the color of the cell cycling through the available ones.

### Design
The orbit for a given cell or pixel is generated as described for `fractal`.
To generate the Buddhabrot and similar fractals, though, these orbit points are then collected in bins which determine the color of the corresponding pixels.
The counts for each pixel are stored in histogram which is described as the plot.

To collect these points, the program selects points uniformly randomly from the complex interval defined by
> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\{a%20+%20bi\;:\;a,%20b%20\in[-2,%202]\}"/>

After generating the orbits for each point, only those which escape between the minimum and maximum number of iterations are kept.
The points from these orbits are then plotted in the histogram.

This process of plotting will occur automatically and continuously unless it is paused using the `P` key.
Hitting the `P` key while paused will restart plotting.

The number of starting points whose orbits the program attempts to plot during every application cycle is indicated by the "Plots Per Second".
Given no user input, the application cycles every second (not including potential calculation time for larger numbers of starting points).
When the user does make keystrokes, the application will make a cycle for each keystroke and so may try to plot many more orbits every second.

\
The pixel values are determined from the histogram by normalizing the counts against the current maximum count.
The resulting pixel color, `p`, is a greyscale value determined from the count, `c`, by
> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p = 255 \cdot \left(\frac{c}{m}\right)^\gamma"/>

where gamma is the provided gamma value and `m` is the maximum value found in the histogram.

\
When navigating, the histogram does not move only the window viewing it does.
To reposition the histogram / plot one must use the `B` key. This clears the histogram and relocates it so it matches with the current viewing window.
The `U` key is provided to allow the user to generate an image of the entire histogram / plot without needing to try to reposition the window around it.
